      I got RSS to work!

    </h1>


    <p>
      now i can see these blog posts in an rss reader of my choice, using <a href="https://fantasydragon14.neocities.org/blog/rss.xml">This link: https://fantasydragon14.neocities.org/blog/rss.xml</a> <br>
      i still don't have a way to access these posts through the website alone, but we get there when we get there. gotta implement a header bar for navigating my posts, but that's coming later (once i get more confident using html)
