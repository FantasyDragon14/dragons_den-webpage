          <h1>Learning about backgrounds and css animating!</h1>

          <p>
            damn, i shouldn't make too many blog posts or i gotta change every
            single one once i get to a 'final' design (a design i'm happy with).
            Hopefully i can find a way to format this without needing to edit
            too much?
          </p>
          <p>
            but enough of that, to css and animating! I learned about sass
            (.scss) recently (the <a href="/dragons-den/playground/stars.html">stars page</a>) is
            programmed <sup>not by me, <a href="https://codepen.io/alphardex/pen/RwrVoeL">the
                sauce</a></sup> using it. I tried reverse engineering the method
            used there to make a cool random clouds background (without js cause
            i want as much as possible to work without it), but i couldn't
            manage to get it to work. maybe once i learn sass more.
          </p>
          <p>
            for now i've settled with using self-made looping pngs, and i'll try
            to get a perspective effect going. You've probably seen the results
            of my efforts in the hub already, depending on when you're reading
            this.
